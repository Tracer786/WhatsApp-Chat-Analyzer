First of all will create the file app.py
Next will install streamlit using the command 'pip install streamlit'
Then will import streamlit in out project
Will create a file with the name 'preprocessor.py'
Will create a function and the code is the same as we wrote in the jyputer notebook
    def preprocess(data): #ek data milega (text/string data)

Next will make the basic app of streamlit to check whether it is working or not
For this we will type the code in the file app.py
    The code that we will use is given below:
        st.sidebar.title("WhatsApp Chat Analyzer")

To run the application we simply need to use the command given below in the terminal:
    'streamlit run app.py'

After that we need to add the button to upload the files for analysis.
For this we need to go to documentation of streamlit and check for the code to upload the file.
Follow the link below to check the code for file uploading:
    https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets/st.file_uploader

Will make some changes to the upload function
The changes are shown in the file app.py


Then will import the preprocessor file in our app.py

Then will call the dataframe from the preprocessor and display it using the code:
    df = preprocessor.preprocess(data)
    st.dataframe(df)
